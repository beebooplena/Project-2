# Design
## font
I used a font from google font called Fuzzy Bubbles. Fuzzy bubbles looks like the name 'fuzzy',
the font reflect the mission of the webpage. To have fun and play the rock paper scissors game.

## Colours
I used colours from coolors.co where the site generates colour schemes. I choosed bright colours that mixed well together
and colours that would highlight the image screens for human and computer player. I also used different colours to the human and computer, so it will be easier to see the results.

## Images
I thought it would be more fun to use images of real items in the game, and not the usually hand gestures that we normally do playing this game. I took pictures of one stone, one scissor and one paper with my mobile phone and used those pictures in the game.

## Icones
I also used icons from fontawesome.com to make the titles more interesting and to help the player to connect the results to the player, so that people that can`t read english or are colourblind can understand this connection better.

# Features

## Logo
You find the logo in the middle of the header. The name gives the description of the site, it`s a rock paper scissors game.
I also added an icon that looks like the hand gesture rock, that can also help the user to understand better that it is a rock paper scissors game.

## Landing page
The webpage has only one page and the user can see the whole game and it`s content.

the winner is the player that receives 5 points first.

The players are given a different colour.

## Footer
  The Footer has the same colour as the header and stays at the bottom of the page that makes it a nice border for the game.

## Future Features
* In the future, I would add more pages with a navigation bar that includes other games.
* I Would add contact information.
* I would add feedback form, where people can give feedback about the games.
* I would include a page where the people can read about the game rules.
* I would alert the winner in a more elegant way, maybe with a nice image attached to it.

## Game and buttons

* clicking on paper button, making sure the image of paper is displayed in the player screen.

Making sure the computer screen is now generating an image of the three choices in the computer screen. Then I check if the player or the computer has won the round and it generates a point to the right player in the result.
* Clicking on reset button, making sure that images are returned to starting images on player screen and computer screen. Making sure that the results are returned to zero.
* I am checking that the alert works when a player has reached 5 points and it declears hwo is the winner. After that I check if the game is resetting.

## Validator tester

### Javascript
* The JShint Javascript code quality tool showed no errors when tested, but showed one warning:
"Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics. (runGame)"
To fix this warning, I could try to to make the loop in to an own function, that would return playerChoice.
